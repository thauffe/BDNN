# Simulations

These are the eight simulated diversification scenarios and the corresponding PyRate analyses of the BDNN manuscript. A simple example on how to simulate a constant diversification scenario together with trait evolution and a synthetic fossil record ready to use in PyRate is shown in the [BDNNsim directory](https://github.com/thauffe/BDNN/tree/main/Simulations/BDNNsim).
